							<h1>Explanation of Health Factors</h1>
							<div class="explanation-container">
								<div class="explanation">
									<h2>Smoking</h2>
									<p>
										Daily smokers are defined as the population aged 15 years and older who are reporting to smoke every
										day. Smoking is a major risk factor for at least two of the leading causes of premature mortality -
										circulatory disease and cancer, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, lung cancer, and
										cancers of the larynx and mouth. In addition, smoking is an important contributing factor for
										respiratory diseases.
									</p>

								<div class="explanation">
									<h2>Obesity</h2>
									<p>
										The overweight or obese population is defined as the inhabitants aged 15 years and older with
										excessive weight presenting health risks because of the high proportion of body fat. The most
										frequently used measure is based on the body mass index (BMI), which is a single number that
										evaluates an individual's weight in relation to height (weight/height², with weight in kilograms and
										height in metres). Based on the WHO classification, adults with a BMI from 25 to 30 are defined as
										overweight, and those with a BMI of 30 or over as obese.
									</p>
									<a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/overweight-or-obese-population.htm">Source</a>
								</div>

								<div class="explanation">
									<h2>Alcohol</h2>
									<p>
										Alcohol consumption is defined as annual sales of pure alcohol in litres per person aged 15 years
										and older. Alcohol use is associated with numerous harmful health and social consequences, including
										an increased risk of a range of cancers, stroke and liver cirrhosis. Alcohol also contributes to
										death and disability through accidents and injuries, assault, violence, homicide and suicide.
									</p>
									<a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/alcohol-consumption.htm">Source</a>
								</div>

								<div class="explanation">
									<h2>Health spending</h2>
									<p>
										Health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services (i.e. current
										health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term
										care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (prevention and public health
										services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments. Health care is
										financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health
										insurance (“Government/compulsory”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as
										households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“Voluntary”). This indicator is
										measured as a share of GDP.
									</p>
									<a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm">Source</a>
								</div>

								<div class="explanation">
									<h2>Hospital beds</h2>
									<p>
										This indicator provides a measure of the resources available for delivering services to inpatients
										in hospitals in terms of number of beds that are maintained, staffed and immediately available for
										use. Total hospital beds include curative (or acute) care beds, rehabilitative care beds, long-term
										care beds and other beds in hospitals. The indicator is measured in number of beds per 1 000
										inhabitants.
